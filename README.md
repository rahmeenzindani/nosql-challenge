This repository contains code and tools to analyze food hygiene ratings data for establishments in the UK. 

The goal of this project is to help the editors of the food magazine Eat Safe, Love evaluate various establishments.

The data used in this project comes from the UK Food Standards Agency, which evaluates various establishments across the UK and assigns them a hygiene rating. 

The analysis will help to answer specific questions related to the hygiene scores, locations, and other metadata about these establishments.
